## About Me
My name is Ibrahim Mohamud Hersi, and I graduated from Jamhuriya University with a degree in computer science. I have a background in full-stack programming. My experience with coding has given me the ability to create dynamic, user-focused applications by enhancing my front-end and back-end skills. In order to someday run a hospital shop in Mogadishu, where I can combine my technical expertise with effective management techniques, I am driven to advance in my career and have a strong love for using technology to address real-world problems.

## Favorite tech
Currently I enjoy working with React.js/Next.js, TailwindCSS, Node.js, Firebase
